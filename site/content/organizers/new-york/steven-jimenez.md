Steven Jimenez has been a leader in tech since graduating from CUNY Queens College in 2014. After graduating, Steven moved to San Francisco where he mostly worked at SurveyMonkey as a Backend Engineer.

At SurveyMonkey, Steven started the first Employee Resource Group called Blatinos. This group is a community within SurveyMonkey for both Black and Latinx professionals. The purpose for this group was to give back to the community, promote career growth, and help steer Diversity & Inclusion initiatives on a corporate level.

Steven currently works for Dom & Tom as a Web Developer. Outside of work, you can find Steven racing on his road bike, dancing cumbia, mentoring youth, cooking, and hoping that the Knicks make the playoffs.
